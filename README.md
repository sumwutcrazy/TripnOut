# TripnOut
This is a trip sharing site that allows users to create a profile, and add trips to their profile in order to either share publicly or privately. Anonymous users can view any publicly shared trips, search for trips by country, or check a tutorial section that provides a library of effective itineraries for various trips throughout the world.

To run locally:
1) CONFIG: Enter mongoDB connection and your own secret in the config.js file
2) With Node installed, run "npm install" to install dependencies outlined in package.json
